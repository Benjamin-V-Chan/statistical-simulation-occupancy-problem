# statistical-simulation-occupancy-problem

## Project Overview

This project simulates and statistically analyzes various airplane boarding strategies using a Monte Carlo approach. Each passenger is modeled as an independent stochastic agent with a travel delay based on row distance and a random luggage stowing time. The total boarding time for each simulation run is calculated and compared across different strategies.

### Mathematical Model

Let $N$ be the total number of passengers, each with a designated row $r_i$ where $1 \leq r_i \leq R$ for total rows $R$. Let $t_r$ be the constant time to walk past one row, and $\delta_i$ be the luggage stowing delay of passenger $i$, drawn from a uniform distribution:
$$\delta_i \sim \mathcal{U}(a, b)$$

Let the entry time $T_i$ be defined recursively:
$$T_i = \max(T_{i-1}, r_i \cdot t_r) + \delta_i$$
with $T_0 = 0$.

This represents a queuing process with blocking, where:
- $r_i \cdot t_r$ is the earliest possible arrival time at the seat,
- $T_{i-1}$ is when the previous passenger clears the aisle.

### Total Boarding Time

The total boarding time $T_{\text{total}}$ is:
$$T_{\text{total}} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq N} T_i$$

As $N \to \infty$, the distribution of $T_{\text{total}}$ converges (by the Central Limit Theorem) to a normal distribution if $\delta_i$ are i.i.d. Additionally, using queuing theory and renewal reward processes, the expected boarding time can be approximated:
$$\mathbb{E}[T_{\text{total}}] \approx N \cdot \mathbb{E}[\delta] + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{E}[\max(0, r_i \cdot t_r - T_{i-1})]$$

### Boarding Strategies

Each strategy modifies the sequence $\{r_i\}$:
- **Random**: $r_i$ are randomly permuted.
- **Back-to-Front**: passengers are sorted descending by $r_i$.
- **Block Boarding**: passengers are grouped by row ranges (blocks), then sorted within each block.

By simulating each strategy over many replications, we derive their empirical distributions and comparative statistics.
