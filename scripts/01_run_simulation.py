# - Import necessary modules
# - Define function simulate_occupancy(num_bins, num_balls, num_trials)
#   - For each trial:
#     - Initialize bins as list of zeros
#     - Randomly assign each ball to a bin (with replacement)
#     - Count:
#       - Number of empty bins
#       - Number of bins with collisions (more than one ball)
#       - Maximum balls in any bin
#     - Store results for each trial
# - Save all trial results to outputs/simulation_results.csv
